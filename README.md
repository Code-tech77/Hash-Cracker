# Hash Cracker Python with Flask Program 👾

### About  
Hash-Cracker is a full-stack password hash cracking tool featuring a Python backend and a web-based frontend built with HTML and CSS. It supports multiple hashing algorithms and offers both wordlist and numeric brute force attack modes through an intuitive web interface for ease of use.

***

### Features  ⭐️
- Multi-algorithm hash cracking (e.g., MD5, SHA1, SHA256).  
- Wordlist-based and numeric brute-force attack modes.  
- User-friendly web interface with HTML and CSS for input and results display.  
- Python backend processes cracking logic and communicates with frontend.  
- Verbose mode and progress tracking.  
- Lightweight and suitable for educational and testing purposes.

***

### How It Works  ⚙️
1. User accesses the web interface to input the hash, select the hash type, and choose attack mode.  
2. Python backend processes the cracking using specified parameters.  
3. Results and progress are displayed back on the web interface dynamically.  

***

### Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Web server environment to serve HTML and CSS files (e.g., Flask, or local hosting)  
- Standard Python libraries (`hashlib`, etc.)  
- Wordlist file for dictionary attacks  

***

### Usage  🎯
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Code-tech77/Hash-Cracker.git
   ```
  
2. Start the backend Python script and serve the frontend files appropriately.  
3. Open the web interface in a browser, enter the hash details, and start cracking.
